# WEB503 Lab Three - Emily Friis

## What have I learnt?

In week 3 of WEB503, we continued to cover the basics of p5.js. For lab three, we were tasked to create sketches to various specifications using JavaScript and a reference to p5.js' CDN in our html files, creating a separate array of css, html, and js files for each task.

### Task One

Task one involved creating a blue quad sketch with no stroke rotated 35 degrees. This task was relatively simple, although the coordinate parameters for the quad() method were difficult to interpret at first.

### Task Two

Task two had us create a rectangle with rounded corners, including a stroke with a weight of 6 and a red colour. Once again this was relatively straightforward.

### Task Three

For task three we were working with 3D sketches, this time creating two shapes: A cylinder and an ellipsoid. To facilitate this, we had to alter the setup function to enable 3D rendering in the canvas creation, by adding the p5.js constant 'WEBGL.' The overlap of the shapes was interesting, and I was unsure how to place them at different coordinates.
