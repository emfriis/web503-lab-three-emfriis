# WEB503 Lab Three - Emily Friis

## What have I learnt?

In week 3 of WEB503, we continued to cover the basics of p5.js. For lab three, we were tasked to create sketches to various specifications using JavaScript and a reference to p5.js' CDN in our html files, creating a separate array of css, html, and js files for each task.

Task one involved creating a blue quad sketch with no stroke rotated 35 degrees. This task was relatively simple, although the coordinate parameters for the quad() method were difficult to interpret at first.
